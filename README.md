# Note-Taking Application
This is a note-taking application built using JavaScript and the interact.js library. It allows users to create, drag, and delete notes. The notes are stored in local storage, ensuring that they persist across page reloads.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: For the core functionality and note management.
- **HTML/CSS**: For the layout and styling of the application.
- **interact.js**: For enabling drag-and-drop functionality.
- **Local Storage**: For persisting notes across sessions.

## Initial Design
before getting to coding the project I made a simple design in excalidraw, so I could understand the vision better.

## How to Use

1. **Add a Note**: Enter a title and description in the input fields and click the "Add Note" button. The note will appear on the screen.
2. **Drag a Note**: Click and drag any note to move it around the screen.
3. **Delete a Note**: Click the "X" button on any note to remove it from the screen and from local storage.
4. **Edit Notes**: User can edit the notes after description creation by double clicking on description text area.
5. **Persistent Notes**: Notes will be saved in local storage and will reappear upon reloading the page (though they may be in a different x, y coordinate).
